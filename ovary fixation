1) Feed flies wet yeast paste for 2 to 3 days by placing a smear of yeast paste on the side of a vial or bottle 

2) Dissect ovaries in ice-cold 1x PBS. After removing an ovary pair from the female abdomen, tease apart the ovaries to allow each ovariole equal access to stains and washes. Do not remove individual ovarioles from the ovary at this point. Transfer the teased apart ovaries to 400µl PBS in a 0.6 ml eppendorf tube on ice. 

3) Collect all of the samples (controls and experiments) and fix them at the same time. 

4) Mix up a tube of 4x fixing solution in a 1.5ml eppendorf containing 1ml of 16% paraformaldehyde: 

Add: 

120 µl of 10x PBS 

20 µl 10% triton X-100 

5) Add 135 µl of 4x fixing solution to each sample (leave existing PBS) and nutate for 13 minutes at room temp. 

6) Remove fixative, add 500 µl of 1x PTX, and nutate for at least 10 min at room temp. 

PTX = 1x PBS + 0.1% TritonX-100 

To make PTX, first make a 10% TritonX-100 stock (5 ml TritonX-100 + 45 ml water) 

Then add 500 µl of 10% TritonX-100 to 50 mL water 

7) Remove PTX, add 500 µl blocking buffer, and nutate for at least 20 min at room temp: 

Blocking buffer: 9.5 ml PTX + 500µl  normal goat serum 

8) Mix up primary antibodies in blocking buffer. Because antibodies are expensive and/or rare, only mix enough for your experiment. For example, if you have 2 samples, mix up 1ml (500µl for each sample). We use most rabbit primary antibodies at 1:1000 but there are exceptions so please look up each antibody in our table. We use many mouse hybridoma antibodies at much higher concentrations so please look those up as well.  

9) Remove blocking buffer, add 500 µl primary antibody solution, and nutate overnight in cold room. 

10) Remove and save primary antibody solution into a shared tube with the date on it. You can use this for several experiments. I usually keep it for 1-2 months in the fridge.  

11) add 500µl PTX and nutate for 10 minutes at room temp. This counts as one wash.  

12) do two more washes 

13) Mix up secondary antibody in blocking buffer. Again, make a single mix for your entire experiment and calculate exactly how much you need. We dilute most secondaries 1:1000. If you want to also stain with DAPI, add 1:1000 of 50 µg/ml DAPI stock solution. If you want to stain Halotag proteins, add the halotag ligand at the desired concentration. 

14) replace last wash with your custom staining solution from previous step and nutate for 3-5 hours at room temp. If you want to look at very late stage nurse cell nuclei, you should do this staining step overnight in the cold room to allow the secondary to permeate well. 

15) Remove (and throw away) staining solution and wash 3 times is PTX just like before. 

16) Replace last wash with 500 µl 50% glycerol in PBS (25 ml glycerol + 5 mL 10X PBS + 20 ml water) and nutate for at least 10 minutes.  

17) cut the tip off a 1ml pipette tip and pipette your sample plus a very small amount of glycerol solution onto a glass slide. You will do the final dissection in this drop. 

18) pull individual ovarioles off the ovaries to separate them. Try to remove the muscle sheath around the germarium. This skill takes practice. 

19) remove any excess glycerol solution with a P20 pipette and add the coverslip. This is also a skill. You want to leave enough to fill the coverslip but not too much that it floats away. You can press gently with a kimwipe to wick up extra glycerol solution. Wipe away any glycerol not under the coverslip. 

20) Paint the edges with nail polish to prevent the slide from drying out. PLEASE allow at least 15 minutes for the nail polish to dry before putting it near a microscope objective.
